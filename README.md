This repository is a compilation of my Ops 201 Ops challenges. Which includes my first bash script, bash functions, bash arrays, bash loops, bash conditionals, Windows batch scripts, scripts that display system information, domain analyzer scripts. Then lastly Powershell Scripts using that include log retrieval, system process commands, automated endpoint cofigurations, and IP analysis. I'm learning these skills to build a foundation of computer operations. Some fundamental concepts I will take with me are the importance of documentation, especially when troubleshotting, backing up your work, and rememberig that I will need to find discomfort in technologies not working but knowing I can figure it out with my experience and interwebs. 

My favorite Ops Challenge had to be system process commands because I learned that it would give me admin utility value and cyber attacker utiliy value which can be good skills to have within the workplace as a tech professional. I also truly enjoyed learning Powershell overall. Having said that, I've yet to conquer my knowsledge when it comes to bash because it didn't speak to me like Powershell did. Therefore, I will be working on improving my bash scripting as I move forward.
